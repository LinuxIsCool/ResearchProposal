* Big Data for Financial Technology - Course Proposal
** Background
The purpose of this proposal is to expose a portfolio of work that I have been
contemplating and working on since Fall of 2015, and to request a partnership
with the Big Data program at SFU to receive resources to continue
this work in the form of research, curriculum production, or some other way. The
theme of this portfolio can be summarized as Big Data for Financial Technology.
The inspiration for studying this field comes from a fascination, and passion
for two independent frontiers of technology: Biologically inspired probabilistic
modelling (AI), and Cryptocurrency Ecosystems. I believe that I have found an
incredibly fascinating niche in the intersection of these two emerging
industrial fields. 

In 2015, I was already obsessed with Bitcoin. I saw it as a liberating
technology with the potential to lubricate global economies, drive financial and
technological innovation, and put an end to post-colonial financial control systems.
I also believed in at as a source of wealth, an intrinsically deflationary currency, a currency that will always be worth more tomorrow than today.
In other words, I saw Bitcoin as a system that rewards people for consuming less, a solution to the capitalistic, materialistic,
consumerism which is driving humans and the planet to destruction. As a young man, who had never
experienced financial wealth, it offered a vehicle for monetary ascension if leveraged properly. Seeing the
extreme volatility in the price of Bitcoin, I began to understand the magnitude to which one could multiply an investment
if they could somehow predict future price movements of Bitcoin.

Fall 2015 I enrolled in a graduate course on Machine Learning with Russ Greiner at University of Alberta. The first lecture was dedicated
to the motivation for machine learning, a preview of the powerful problems that can be solved with probabilistic modelling rather than explicit programming.
It instantly clicked in my head that machine learning could be used to model the price movement of Bitcoin. I have dedicated my life since then to accomplishing
just that.

Since that time, I have continued relentlessly studying AI and Cryptocurrencies. I took a course on Reinforcement Learning with Richard Sutton, AI in games, 
Probabilistic Graphical Models, as well as online courses: Machine Learning with Andrew NG, Deep Learning with Tensorflow, and Bitcoin and Cryptocurrecy Technology.

After graduating my undergrad, I spent the subsequent four months attempting to manifest my vision. I was implementing rudimentary trading algorithms, collecting
social media data from twitter, and reddit, attempting to collect price history data, aggregate this data, and apply a machine learning model which could execute
automated trades.

**** Big Data in Banking, Assets, and the Economy
     Introduction to Financial Technology
     Assets and the Economy as Big Data
     Risk Management
     Arbitrage
**** Time Series, Signal Processing, Streaming and Dynamic Data
***** Time Series
     This area is, I believe, the most significant gap in the content covered by 
Programming for Big Data I and II. The only case in which time series data is mentioned
is in the context of Natural Language Processing. I believe Time Series analysis deserves
a dedicated study in it's own right. Time Series analysis is critical when working with
datasets such as Audio, Price Movement, EEG signals, Sensor Data, Web analysis, and security.

***** Signal Processing
      Fourier Transform is a fundamental concept for Data manipulation which is not
covered in the Big Data program. It is relevant in Image processing, audio processing,
signal processing of any kind in which you wish to move from the time domain to 
the frequency domain.

***** Streaming Data
      Working with streaming data is a very hot topic in Big Data today. Financial applications often necessetate work with
streaming data. FinTech could serve as the perfect sandbox for Big Data students to practice working with data streaming. For
example, [[https://spark.apache.org/streaming/][Spark Streaming]] is a very new tool that students should become familiar with.
